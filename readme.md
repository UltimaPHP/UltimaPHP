## UltimaPHP - Ultima Online OpenSource Server

UltimaPHP is a modern Ultima Online server written in PHP 7.0.

This server was created for thoes who ever wanted to create differend addaptations on the core of your shard.

I decided to build this project for study propose i've re-scripted the entire socket server to understand how it works and after that i decided to create a lightweight standalone version of the server that runs in any OS easly.

Note: The server only works with the last updated Ultima Online client (7.0.70.10) and we will not spent time with older clients for now.

## How to install?

First of all you will need to install PHP 7.0 or greater and MongoDb 3.4+, I reccomend you to use PHP 7.1 it's ultra fast and lightweight, for that:

* [PHP download page](http://php.net/downloads.php) and get the version of PHP you want to use
* [MongoDB page](https://www.mongodb.com) and get the right version of mongodb for your machine.

After install PHP and MongoDB on the machine, edit the file ```ultimaphp.ini``` as you wish, create a mongodb database named "ultimaphp" (or anyone, just need to change at the ultimaphp.ini) and create/import all collections from ```tools/Mongo Database/*.json``` (file name is the collection name) and follow the next steps to start the server:

Note 1: You can use some program to visualize and work with mongodb like: [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org/download) or [MongoChef](https://studio3t.com/download/)

Note 2: The default owner account/password in the database is: test/test

Note 3: The default player account/password in the database is: test2/test

Note 4: Passwords is allways stored in MD5 encryption both in database and in server variables

Note 5: UltimaPHP only works (till now) with no-encrypted clients.

### Linux

 * Open the terminal and navigate to the root folder of UltimaPHP project
 * Type: ```php7.0 startserver.php```

### Mac

 * We need someone with mac to help us :)

### Windows

 * Open the run dialog (SUPER+R) and type ```cmd``` then run
 * Navigate to PHP installation folder ```cd c:\php\installation\folder\```
 * And start the server ```php.exe c:\ultimaphp\instalation\folder\startserver.php```

## Base PHP compilation
#### For those, like me, who preffer to use an most performatic standalone PHP, with only what it really needs
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-config-file-path=/etc --enable-sockets --enable-bcmath --enable-mbstring --enable-zip --enable-pcntl --enable-ftp --enable-exif --enable-sysvmsg --enable-sysvsem --enable-sysvshm --enable-wddx --with-mcrypt --with-iconv --with-zlib-dir=/usr --with-xpm-dir=/usr --with-openssl --with-gettext=/usr --with-zlib=/usr --with-bz2=/usr
make
make install
```
